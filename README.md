A website to promote, inform and sell the tickets for a web development course. It consists of three pages: 

* The home page, which supplies an overview of the course

![About page](/assets/images/About-page.png?raw=true "About page")

* A page to purchase tickets for the event

The website was implemented with HTML tags, CSS and its associated tools (such as flex-box, floats and grid), as well as the Bootstrap framework, to properly position and style the diferent elements and sections of the page. It was implemented to be responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop view.
