            <h5>DesignWebtech Logo</h5>
            <p>We would like to acknowledge the contribution of Graphic Creators Inc. to DesignWebtech in having designed the log by which we present ourselves to the world at large.</p>
            <p>The logo was decided by competition from among the submissions by participants of the many previous generations of DesignWebtech Web Development Courses.</p>
            <p>We believe its slick lines, its contrast between neutral black and warm orange, and the pattern formed by two interwoven squares with rounded edges with eye-like circles at the center of their intersection neatly symbolizes the mix of technical complexity and artistic sensibility which characterizes web-design.</p>
